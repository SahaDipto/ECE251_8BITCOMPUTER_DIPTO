The ISA was based on the ISA provided by Professor Marano for ECE251-CompArch class for spring 2022.


Initially the computer had 8 registers, however that limited the number of immediate bits in our ISA. We chose to go with 4 registers as that would 
reduce the number of selection bits for the registers. We also specified a shftamt, as we can only shift an 8 bit number up to 3 bits. 

The code for the computer was a factorial program. It would calculate 5 factorial, store the value into memory, and then load it to a different register.
This program showed R-type, Logic and Arithmetic I-type, LOAD, STORE, flags, and J-type branching. 

The finish command was 16'b0000000000000000; which was based on how in C and C++ a function would return 0 to show that it successfully compiled.


Suggestions for future project similar to this would be to first individually test the various submodules to make sure that they compile and run properly. This
proved to be tremendously useful in reducing time spent on this project. Individually testing is much easier than testing collectively.
